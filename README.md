# Game-4
Game-4 project for COMP55

This is a java based open world exploration sandbox game.
In this game the player fights enemies and explores castles, collecting fun and powerful items
along the way. Eventually, the player will come face-to-face with the boss in one of the castles.
Once defeated, the boss will drop a special trophy to commemorate the endgame challenge and the player can either continue to explore the world or end their game.

The game is in a complete state. All features that have been planned to be implemented were made such as
saving, randomly generating structures and biomes as the player progresses, a functioning main menu, inventory menu with hotbar extension, and more.

Of course, there can always be more things to add. For example:

  - A resource meter for magic when using the ice and fire rods to mitigate spamming.

  - Addtional unique items to keep the players invested.

  - More enemies and bosses to increase the challege within the game.

  - More structures and locations to expand the identity of the world generated.
    
  - Including SoundFx

  - Cleaner and more organized UI

  - More animations

Maybe in the future, someone from the team (or maybe even everyone that was involved) can come back together to
have fun improving the game and seeing where they take the game from there.

You can play the game by downloading the game4_final_final.zip folder, extracting it, and running the jar.
